# Results Folder README

## Overview

This folder contains the results and evaluations from the machine learning models developed and tested during the project. It includes comprehensive performance metrics, visualizations, and the final model's detailed outputs.

## Structure

1. **Model Evaluation Metrics**

   - Contains CSV files with performance metrics for each trained model.
   - Metrics include:
     - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
     - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
     - R-squared (RÂ²)
     - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

2. **Predicted vs Actual Visualizations**

   - PNG files comparing predicted values to actual target values for each model.
   - Helps in assessing model performance visually.

3. **Residual Plots**

   - PNG files showing residuals for each model.
   - Indicates the distribution and patterns of residuals to validate model assumptions.

4. **Feature Importance**

   - PNG files showing feature importance for tree based models.
   - It helps identify the key factors that influence global active power (energy consumption).

5. **Final Model Results**

   - A dedicated subfolder containing outputs from the final selected model.
   - Includes:
     - Metrics CSV: Performance metrics of the final model.
     - Predicted vs Actual PNG: Visualization for the final model.
     - Feature Importance: identify the key factors that influence global active power (energy consumption).


## Instructions

### Accessing Results

- Open the CSV files with any spreadsheet software or use a Python library like Pandas to load and analyze them programmatically.
- View the PNG files with any image viewer or include them in reports or presentations.

### Using the Final Model Results

- The final model results represent the best-performing model after evaluation and comparison.
- These files can be directly used for reporting or further analysis.

## Notes

- Ensure all files are properly backed up and version-controlled to prevent data loss.
- If adding new results or visualizations, maintain the existing naming conventions for consistency.
